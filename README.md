# NewMoomieApp

## Getting Started 

To launch the Moomie App inside Android studio simply build the app under API 23 and Android Version 4.0.3

## Classes 

Most classes in this app are self explanatory. 
  Mainfragment - handles our facebook login and login button
  MyApplication - handles the generation of a unique haskey that will allow facebook to recognize our app
  menu - linked from facebook login button allows use of navigation drawer for most features in the app
  
  most other classes are in the form of fragment which branch off of the menu class.
